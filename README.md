| 🚀 Focus | 🧭 Approach | 📌 Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Utility automation, knowledge architecture, calm technology, and systems experiments. | Start with the user journey, ship in small slices, measure everything, and prefer boring tech where it keeps teams fast. | Confident releases, searchable context, clearer decisions, and less operational noise. |

## What I make
- Decision-support helpers that turn scattered notes or data into clear, shareable narratives.
- Lightweight automation that removes repetitive overhead for product, research, and ops teams.
- Internal developer experience improvements: better defaults, sharper documentation, and traceable changes.
- Prototypes that stress-test new product directions before they scale.

## Spotlight: recent project patterns
- **Narrative intelligence** — aligning product docs, transcripts, and metrics into a single story that decision makers can trust.
- **Ops calm-down** — alert routing, runbooks, and guardrails that lower noise while keeping response crisp.
- **Research-to-shipping loop** — workflows that turn insights into tickets, specs, and experiments without losing intent.

## How I work
- **Intentional discovery:** Map the problem, instrument feedback loops, and align on the win condition.
- **Crisp delivery:** Ship iteratively with visible milestones, release notes, and rollback plans.
- **Calm interfaces:** Reduce noise, highlight the critical path, and make the next action obvious.
- **Open collaboration:** Clear handoffs, purposeful naming, and code that’s easy to adopt.

## Collaboration snapshot
- ✅ Research-driven framing before building.
- 🔄 Tight loops with stakeholders and users.
- 📖 Documentation and demos for every deliverable.
- 🧪 Targeted experiments where they create outsized learning.

If you need pragmatic systems that make teams faster and more confident, let’s build together.

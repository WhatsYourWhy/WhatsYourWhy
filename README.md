### 🧭 Surface Signal

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧰 Utility | Minimalist tools for clarity, not speed. |
| 🧠 Thought Architecture | Scaffolding for internal cognition and memory loops. |
| 🌿 Calm Tech | Low-stim, high-signal systems that breathe instead of blink. |
| ⊙ Emergence Engines | Theoretical experiments. Some runnable. Some not yet. |

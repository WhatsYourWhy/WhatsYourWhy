# WhatsYourWhy

I build small, local-first systems that turn messy information into reusable structure.

**Systems builder focused on local-first, high-signal tools that reduce noise and improve decision-making.**

I compress notes, transcripts, and operational data into reusable structure so teams can act without wading through noise. I prefer clarity, determinism, and local-first workflows that keep context close and decisions explainable.

**Primary focus**
- Utility automation
- Knowledge architecture
- Calm technology
- Systems experiments

**What teams get**
- Confident releases
- Searchable context
- Clearer decisions
- Less operational noise

## What I make
- Document distillers that compress messy notes into reusable structure.
- Decision-support helpers that turn evidence into clear, shareable narratives.
- Lightweight automation that removes repetitive overhead for product, research, and ops teams.
- DX improvements that sharpen defaults, documentation, and traceability.

## Project patterns I ship
- **Information compression** — distill notes, docs, and data into reusable structure with evidence trails.
- **Operational noise reduction** — tame alerts, handoffs, and status churn so teams act on signal.
- **Research-to-shipping loops** — move insights into tickets, specs, and experiments without losing intent.

## How I work
- Start with intent.
- Ship in slices.
- Design for calm.
- Document as infrastructure.

## Collaboration snapshot
- Research-driven framing.
- Tight loops with stakeholders.
- Documentation and demos.
- Targeted experiments for learning.

If you need systems that reduce noise, preserve context, and stay out of the way, I’m interested in building them.

### Operational systems. Deterministic decision tooling. Infrastructure that holds.

<p>
  <em>I build systems that are meant to work — not impress.</em>
</p>

<p>
  I’ve led teams, owned outcomes, and seen what breaks when tools are built for demos instead of reality.
  This profile is a working record of systems designed for pressure: inspectable, versioned, and explainable.

## What this GitHub is for

I ship practical systems and structured research for:

- Turning noisy inputs into structured decisions.
- Reducing operational friction.
- Preserving context across handoffs.
- Making reasoning visible and auditable.

> If a system can’t be inspected, versioned, and explained, it doesn’t ship.

## Start Here

- If you want deterministic decision infrastructure with explainable outputs, start with [**Hardstop**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/hardstop).
- If you want a framework for auditable execution and replay, start with [**Determinant**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/determinant) and [**The Temporal Gradient**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/temporal-gradient).
- If you want practical local-first utilities for messy real-world inputs, start with [**Strainer CLI**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/strainer-cli).

## Selected Work

| Project | What it does | Status | Maturity | Primary focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [**Hardstop**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/hardstop) | Deterministic supply-chain risk engine with recall, explainability, and reason-coded outputs. | Active | Production-oriented | Ops tooling |
| [**Determinant**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/determinant) | Structured runtime for executing programs with auditable decision paths. | Active | Beta | Runtime systems |
| [**The Temporal Gradient**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/temporal-gradient) | Bounded time and memory modeling framework for reliable simulation and replay. | Experimental | Prototype | Simulation |
| [**Alert-Axolotl-Evo**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/alert-axolotl-evo) | Evolutionary alert logic experiment to surface robust signal patterns. | Experimental | Prototype | Signal discovery |
| [**Strainer CLI**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/strainer-cli) | Local-first text → structure conversion for cleaner operational inputs. | Active | Beta | Data shaping |
| [**Cognitive Glow**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/cognitive-glow) | Knowledge visibility tooling for Obsidian to make reasoning and context discoverable. | Maintained | Beta | Knowledge systems |

Some projects are practical utilities.
Some are structured experiments.
All are intentional.

## How I Build

- Define the win condition before writing code.
- Design for failure modes, not just happy paths.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Ship in small, measurable slices.
- Treat documentation as part of the system.

---

## Evidence of Impact

- Public portfolio of operational systems and structured experiments built in the open.
- Repositories prioritize inspectable logic, explicit assumptions, and auditable outputs.
- Tooling is designed for pressure-tested workflows where handoffs and traceability matter.
- Writing and project docs focus on decision quality, reproducibility, and execution discipline.

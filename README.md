# WhatsYourWhy

A concise profile of the systems and products I build—practical tools with clear outcomes, grounded in research and thoughtful design.

## Focus areas
- **Utility tooling:** Small, reliable utilities that prioritize clarity over cleverness.
- **Knowledge architecture:** Structures for thinking, memory, and collaboration that help teams find signal quickly.
- **Calm technology:** Interfaces and workflows that reduce noise while keeping critical information visible.
- **Systems experiments:** Prototypes that explore emergent behavior and new interaction models.

## What I work on
- Decision-support helpers that turn scattered notes or data into actionable views.
- Lightweight automation that removes repetitive overhead for product and research teams.
- Internal developer experience improvements: better defaults, sharper documentation, and traceable changes.
- Prototyping and validation sprints to test new product directions before they scale.

## How I work
- Start with the user journey, then instrument everything for feedback.
- Ship in small increments with crisp documentation and observability.
- Prefer boring, reliable tech where it matters and targeted experimentation where it counts.
- Collaborate openly—clear handoffs, intentional naming, and approachable code.

If you’re looking for calm, effective systems that make teams faster and more confident, that’s the kind of work I do.

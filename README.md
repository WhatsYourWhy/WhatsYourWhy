<b>Founder, Shank Strategy Ops; operational strategy, execution systems, and deterministic decision tooling.</b>

<p>I build calm, high-signal systems for organizations that need to move from insight to execution without chaos. My work focuses on operational reality: risk visibility, bounded decision systems, and tools that hold up under pressure.</p>

<p>This GitHub hosts open-source and research projects that support that work — local-first utilities, deterministic engines, and small, well-documented systems designed to turn messy inputs into auditable outcomes.</p>

| 🚀 Focus | 🧭 Approach | 📌 Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Utility automation, knowledge architecture, calm technology, and systems experiments. | Start with intent, ship in small slices, measure what matters, prefer boring tech where it keeps teams fast. | Clearer decisions, searchable context, confident releases, and less operational noise. |

## What I make

- **Document distillers** that compress messy notes, Markdown, and transcripts into reusable structure.
- **Decision-support helpers** that turn evidence into clear, shareable narratives.
- **Lightweight automation** that removes repetitive overhead for product, research, and ops teams.
- **DX improvements** that sharpen defaults, documentation, and traceability.

---

## Project patterns I ship

- **Information compression**  
  Distilling notes, docs, and operational data into structured outputs with evidence trails.

- **Operational noise reduction**  
  Taming alerts, handoffs, and status churn so teams act on signal instead of volume.

- **Research-to-shipping loops**  
  Moving insights into tickets, specs, and experiments without losing intent.

---

## How I work

- **Intent first** — define the win condition and failure modes before building.
- **Slice delivery** — ship iteratively with visible milestones and rollback paths.
- **Design for calm** — reduce cognitive load and make the next action obvious.
- **Docs as infrastructure** — names, context, and decisions that survive handoff.

---

## Collaboration snapshot

- Research-driven framing before code.
- Tight feedback loops with stakeholders and users.
- Documentation and demos for every deliverable.
- Targeted experiments where learning is asymmetric.

If you need systems that reduce noise, preserve context, and stay out of the way, I’m interested in building them.

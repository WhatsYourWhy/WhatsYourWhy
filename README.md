  <p><strong>Operational systems. Deterministic decision tooling. Infrastructure that holds.</strong></p>

  <p>I build systems that are meant to work — not impress. My background is operational: I’ve led teams, owned outcomes, and seen what breaks when decisions are rushed or tools are built for demos instead of reality. That experience shapes everything here.</p>

  <p>This GitHub hosts practical systems and research projects focused on turning noisy inputs into structured decisions, reducing operational friction, preserving context across handoffs, and making reasoning visible and auditable.</p>

## What I make

- Document distillers that compress messy notes, Markdown, and transcripts into reusable structure.  
- Decision-support helpers that turn evidence into clear, shareable narratives.  
- Operational noise reduction that tames alerts, handoffs, and status churn so teams act on signal instead of volume.  
- Research-to-shipping loops that move insights into tickets, specs, and experiments without losing intent.  
- DX improvements that sharpen defaults, documentation, and traceability.

## Selected work

- [Hardstop](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/hardstop) — deterministic supply-chain risk engine built around recall, explainability, and reason-coded outputs.  
- [Determinant](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/determinant) — structured runtime for executing programs with auditable decision paths.  
- [The Temporal Gradient](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/temporal-gradient) — bounded time and memory modeling framework for reliable simulation and replay.  
- [Alert-Axolotl-Evo](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/alert-axolotl-evo) — evolutionary alert logic experiment to surface robust signal patterns.  
- [Strainer CLI](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/strainer-cli) — local-first text → structure conversion for cleaner operational inputs.  
- [Cognitive Glow](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/cognitive-glow) — knowledge visibility tooling for Obsidian to make reasoning and context discoverable.

(If a link above is broken, replace it with the exact repo path — I can update these for you.)

## How I build

- Define the win condition before writing code.  
- Design for failure modes, not just happy paths.  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.  
- Ship in small, measurable slices.  
- Treat documentation as part of the system.

If a system can’t be inspected, versioned, and explained, it doesn’t ship.

## Collaboration snapshot

- Research-driven framing before code.  
- Tight feedback loops with stakeholders and users.  
- Documentation and demos for every deliverable.  
- Targeted experiments where learning is asymmetric.

If you’re building infrastructure that must hold under scrutiny, I’m interested. Reach out.

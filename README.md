### Operational systems. Deterministic decision tooling. Infrastructure that holds.

<p>
  <em>I build systems that are meant to work — not impress.</em>
</p>

<p>
  I’ve led teams, owned outcomes, and seen what breaks when tools are built for demos instead of reality.
  This profile is a working record of systems designed for pressure: inspectable, versioned, and explainable.

## What this GitHub is for

I ship practical systems and structured research for:

- Turning noisy inputs into structured decisions.
- Reducing operational friction.
- Preserving context across handoffs.
- Making reasoning visible and auditable.

> If a system can’t be inspected, versioned, and explained, it doesn’t ship.

## Selected Work

| Project | What it does |
|---|---|
| [**Hardstop**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/hardstop) | Deterministic supply-chain risk engine with recall, explainability, and reason-coded outputs. |
| [**Determinant**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/determinant) | Structured runtime for executing programs with auditable decision paths. |
| [**The Temporal Gradient**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/temporal-gradient) | Bounded time and memory modeling framework for reliable simulation and replay. |
| [**Alert-Axolotl-Evo**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/alert-axolotl-evo) | Evolutionary alert logic experiment to surface robust signal patterns. |
| [**Strainer CLI**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/strainer-cli) | Local-first text → structure conversion for cleaner operational inputs. |
| [**Cognitive Glow**](https://github.com/WhatsYourWhy/cognitive-glow) | Knowledge visibility tooling for Obsidian to make reasoning and context discoverable. |

Some projects are practical utilities.
Some are structured experiments.
All are intentional.

## How I Build

- Define the win condition before writing code.
- Design for failure modes, not just happy paths.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Ship in small, measurable slices.
- Treat documentation as part of the system.
